Answer the following questions.

EXERCISE 1
----------

1. Which suggestion made by Eclipse to fix the error in line 16 makes sense?
To make the variables static

2. What is the error in line 21?
Missing a closed quotation mark

3. What line caused the program to crash?
The for loop in line 17

Why does the program crash?
Because there is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException error

4. What do you think the program is going to print?
i = 10
i = 3 arr[0] = 0 arr[1] = 0 arr[2] = 0

EXERCISE 2
----------

5. Which line of the program causes it to crash?
line 8

6. Why did the value of testArray[0][0] not change?
because j is only incremented after the inner loop has done a full iteration, the first time the inner loop is executed, j is equal to 0

EXERCISE 3
----------

7. Which line of the program causes it to crash?
Line 10 causes the program to crash because you divide by zero

8. Which line is highlighted after pressing F6?
line 10

9. What is the difference between F6 (Step over) and F5 (Step into)?
Step over will  execute the current line of code and move to the next line, while step into will go inside a method or function and execute each line of code one by one

10. Why does the program crashes if you press F6 again?
Because you divide by zero


EXERCISE 4
----------

11. Why the compiler shows an error even though i has been declared in the loop: for (int i = 1; i < 2; ++i)?
Because it is out of the scope of the brackets. To use i it must be in the for loop

12. What do you think will be the values of variables var1 and the String in obj1 immediately after method2(obj1) is executed?
Value of var1 should be -20 and the string should be "joe' after method2 is executed

What do you think will be the values of variables var1 and the String in obj1 immediately after method1(obj1) is executed?
Value of var1 should be 10 and the string should be "joe' after method2 is executed

13. What are the correct values of variables var1 and the String in obj1 immediately after method2(obj1) is executed?
Value of var1 should be -20 and the string should be "joe' after method2 is executed

14. Why is the result of the comparison (obj1 == obj2) false even though both obj1 and obj2 contain the same information, namely "joe"? 
Because they compare the references of the object, not the contents
